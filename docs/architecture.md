# Architecture

## 1. Architectural objective

rustX is an execution kernel, not an agent application framework and not a control plane. Its responsibility is to execute an immutable runtime manifest, produce durable execution facts, and expose stable runtime-owned contracts to higher-level systems.

The architecture is layered so that external SDKs, storage backends, process managers, and UI protocols can change without rewriting the agent kernel.

## 2. Layer model

### Layer 0: Domain and protocol types

This layer contains runtime-owned data contracts only:

- Message blocks and content blocks
- Model requests and model events
- Tool definitions, calls, and results
- Runtime events
- Runtime manifest
- Attempt, turn, and capability identifiers

It must not depend on provider SDKs, MCP SDKs, databases, HTTP frameworks, or process implementations.

## 2.1 Implemented Layer 0 contracts (M1)

The canonical contracts defined in M1 live in the `src` module tree as follows:

```text
runtime/identity.rs        strong IDs (ConversationId, MessageId, AgentId,
                           AgentVersionId, AttemptId, TurnId, EventId, ToolId,
                           ToolCallId, ToolVersionId, McpServerId, SkillId,
                           SkillVersionId, ArtifactId) and CapabilityRevision
runtime/types.rs           CancellationReason, RuntimeError
runtime/continuation.rs   ProviderContinuationState boundary (OpenAI Responses
                           stored/stateless, Anthropic opaque state)
message/content.rs         TextBlock, ImageReference, FileReference
message/types.rs           MessageBlock (System/User/Agent/Tool), provenance
                           (SystemAuthority, UserSource, InboundKind),
                           ContentBlockIndex, content enums per role
tools/types.rs             ToolDefinition, ToolCall, ToolCallStart,
                           ToolExecutionResult, ToolExecutionStatus,
                           ToolExecutionMode, ToolReplayPolicy, ToolOrigin,
                           TruncationState
model/types.rs             ModelRequest, ModelUsage, ModelProtocol,
                           ReasoningEffort
model/finish.rs            ModelFinishReason
model/error.rs             ModelError, ModelErrorKind
model/event.rs             ModelEvent (adapter-to-kernel streaming protocol)
events/types.rs            RuntimeEventEnvelope, RuntimeEvent, AttemptOutcome,
                           AttemptFailure
protocol/manifest.rs       RuntimeManifest and capability/context/limit sections
model/adapter/traits.rs    ModelAdapter runtime-owned interface, ModelEventStream
model/adapter/cancellation.rs  ModelCancellation (rustX-owned cancellation)
model/adapter/validation.rs    deterministic local capability validation
model/adapter/block_index.rs   provider-key to ContentBlockIndex allocator
model/adapter/openai/     OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses adapters
                           (async-openai, custom no-retry HTTP service)
model/adapter/anthropic/  Anthropic Messages adapter (direct HTTP/SSE,
                           no Anthropic SDK)
```

Dependency direction between the modules points inward toward the shared
runtime-owned types:

```text
protocol → model, runtime
events   → message, model, tools, runtime
model    → message, tools, runtime
message  → tools, runtime
tools    → runtime
```

Serialization conventions for persistence-facing types:

- Enums use explicit discriminators with stable snake_case values
  (`"role"` for `MessageBlock`, `"type"` for events and content blocks).
- Strong IDs serialize as transparent JSON strings; `CapabilityRevision`
  serializes as a plain JSON number.
- Timestamps are UTC RFC 3339 strings (`chrono::DateTime<Utc>`).
- Durations are integer milliseconds (`duration_ms`, `retry_after_ms`).
- `serde_json::Value` is used only for genuinely arbitrary JSON: JSON
  Schema, tool-call arguments, structured tool output, and opaque provider
  continuation payloads.
- Persistence-facing structures never use `HashMap`; ordering is explicit.

The three execution layers each consume these contracts: the agent kernel
operates on them, the context engine assembles them into provider context,
and the model plane translates them to and from provider protocols.

### 2.2 Attempt settlement invariant

Exactly one terminal runtime event settles an attempt, and each terminal
event carries only the data valid for that state:

```text
AttemptCompleted      finish reason
AttemptCancelled      cancellation reason
AttemptTimedOut       -
AttemptLimitExceeded  exceeded limit
AttemptFailed         normalized AttemptFailure
```

`AttemptCompleted` never carries a failure outcome, and unknown event
payload fields are rejected on deserialization, so contradictory terminal
encodings are impossible by construction. The platform-level `AttemptOutcome`
type maps one-to-one with these terminal events via
`AttemptOutcome::from_terminal_event`. When an attempt fails because a model
request exhausted its retry policy, `AttemptFailure::Model` preserves the
normalized `ModelError` without degrading it to a runtime error string.

### 2.3 Streaming assembly identity

`ModelEvent` (and the corresponding `RuntimeEvent` deltas) target content
blocks by the rustX-owned `ContentBlockIndex`: the position of the block
within the ordered `AgentContentBlock[]` of the message being assembled.
Interleaved text, reasoning, refusal, tool-call, and provider
continuation-state streaming therefore assembles unambiguously without
exposing any provider block id type. Refusal streams as refusal
(`RefusalDelta` / `AgentRefusalDelta`) and assembles into
`AgentContentBlock::Refusal`, never into plain text. `ToolCallStarted`
carries only the data known at start (`ToolCallStart`: call id, tool id,
name); raw argument fragments stream via `ToolCallArgumentsDelta`, and the
fully assembled `ToolCall` is emitted only at `ToolCallCompleted`.

### 2.4 Tool execution event identity

Every tool execution event carries the executing tool call identity:
`ToolExecutionStarted`, `ToolExecutionProgress`, `ToolExecutionCompleted`,
and `ToolExecutionFailed` all carry `tool_call_id` and `tool_id`. With
parallel execution, completion order may differ from call order, and each
completion remains attributable to its originating call. `ToolExecutionResult`
itself stays reusable and carries no call identity; identity is attached at
the event and message boundary only.

### 2.5 Message content single source of truth

The durable Message Ledger (M8) is the only authoritative store for canonical
message content. `AgentMessageCommitted` and `ToolMessageCommitted` are
execution facts that reference the committed message by its stable
`MessageId` and never embed the message body, so the Event Journal never
holds a competing copy.

A committed-message event must not be emitted before the corresponding
`MessageBlock` has been durably committed to the Message Ledger. Message
Ledger persistence and Event Journal persistence are separate durable
operations unless a backend provides a shared atomic transaction; M8 owns
the atomicity or crash-reconciliation boundary between these stores. If a
crash occurs after the `MessageBlock` is durably committed but before the
corresponding committed-message event is appended, recovery must recognize
and reconcile that state rather than treating the message as absent or
duplicating its content.

Persist-before-publish applies to `RuntimeEvent` publication only: append
the event durably before publishing it externally. It does not by itself
provide a transaction with the Message Ledger.

### Layer 1: Agent kernel

The kernel owns deterministic execution semantics:

- Attempt state machine
- Turn lifecycle
- Model -> tool -> model loop
- Tool batch ordering
- Turn-boundary inbound message draining
- Attempt termination rules
- Retry and compaction decision points

The kernel operates only on rustX canonical types and interfaces.

### Layer 2: Context engine

The context engine owns what the model sees:

- Context assembly
- Token accounting
- Context checkpoints
- Pi-style compaction
- Valid compaction cut-point selection
- Split-turn summaries
- Provider-context compilation

Compaction is a projection of durable conversation history. It must never delete or rewrite the canonical history.

### Layer 3: Model plane

The model plane implements protocol adapters:

- OpenAI Chat Completions
- OpenAI Responses
- Anthropic Messages

The M2 implementation freezes the model-plane boundary:

```text
Provider HTTP / SDK
        |
adapter-private provider representation
        |
ModelAdapter
        |
ModelEvent
        |
future M3 Agent Loop
```

Provider SDK and wire types terminate inside the adapter modules
(`src/model/adapter/openai`, `src/model/adapter/anthropic`); the agent kernel
operates only on the runtime-owned `ModelAdapter` interface and the
`ModelEvent` stream.

#### OpenAI adapters (async-openai)

Both OpenAI adapters use the `async-openai` crate for typed request types,
the SDK client plumbing, and SSE stream consumption. Two properties are
enforced by construction:

- Automatic retry is bypassed. The SDK's default executor wraps the plain
  transport in `OpenAIRetryLayer`; the adapters install a rustX-owned custom
  HTTP service (`NoRetryService`) that executes exactly one `reqwest` request
  per call and performs no retry. One adapter invocation is exactly one
  provider request attempt.
- The Chat Completions response stream and the entire Responses protocol use
  the SDK's BYOT (bring-your-own-type) facility as raw JSON, so unknown
  finish reasons, unknown event fields, and future item shapes are tolerated,
  and preserved Responses continuation items round-trip losslessly.

The no-retry service also captures the provider HTTP status, `Retry-After`
header, and error payload at the transport boundary, because the SDK's typed
error drops response headers.

#### Anthropic Messages (direct HTTP/SSE)

Anthropic has no official Rust SDK, and the evaluated community SDK
(`anthropic-sdk-rust` 0.1.x) has stale typed stop-reason coverage relative to
the current Messages API. The Anthropic adapter therefore talks to
`/v1/messages` directly with `reqwest` and `eventsource-stream`:

- correct current streaming semantics (cumulative `message_delta` usage,
  `fallback` blocks, `pause_turn`, `model_context_window_exceeded`);
- current stop-reason coverage (`end_turn`, `stop_sequence`, `tool_use`,
  `max_tokens`, `model_context_window_exceeded`, `refusal`, `pause_turn`);
- forward-compatible event parsing (unknown top-level events never crash the
  parser);
- transparent retry ownership (the transport performs exactly one HTTP
  request per invocation; no retry, no reconnect, no failover);
- no SDK type leakage (there is no Anthropic SDK dependency at all).

The Anthropic wire representation is private to
`src/model/adapter/anthropic/wire.rs`; no alternative canonical Anthropic
model exists.

#### Normalization rules

- `ContentBlockIndex` is assigned by rustX, never by the provider. A
  provider-index-to-canonical-index allocator maps provider block identity to
  canonical positions in first-appearance order, so provider-only blocks
  (Anthropic `fallback`), provider tool indexes, and different content-part
  layers never shift canonical indexes.
- Tool names resolve deterministically to canonical `ToolId` values before a
  request is sent; duplicate model-facing names are rejected before any
  provider request. Provider call ids remain `ToolCallId`; they are never
  synthesized from `ToolId` or from array position.
- Tool argument fragments stream raw (`ToolCallArgumentsDelta`) and the
  complete JSON is parsed exactly once at completion. Malformed completed
  JSON terminates the invocation with a normalized failure.
- Continuation state is emitted through the canonical
  `ProviderContinuationState` boundary, never kept in hidden adapter memory.
  OpenAI Responses supports both `Stored` (provider storage,
  `previous_response_id`) and `Stateless` (`store: false`, preserved output
  items including opaque encrypted reasoning). Anthropic thinking signatures
  are preserved as rustX-owned opaque JSON on the reasoning block.
- Cancellation is a rustX-owned signal (`ModelCancellation`) flowing through
  the common interface; an in-flight invocation stops consuming the provider
  stream, performs no retry, and terminates with `Failed(Cancelled)`.
- Live integration tests are opt-in (`#[ignore]`): ordinary CI runs
  `cargo test --all-targets --all-features` without credentials or network.
  A developer CLI smoke tool (`examples/model_smoke.rs`) streams one response
  per protocol against production credentials.

### Layer 4: Tool plane

The tool plane exposes a single runtime-owned execution contract and multiple executor implementations:

- Native tools
- MCP tools
- Custom Python tools
- Platform communication tools such as durable message sending

Execution implementations may depend on `rmcp`, process APIs, `uv`, or other libraries. The agent kernel may not.

### Layer 5: Skill plane

Skills are filesystem/workflow packages. A skill may include:

- `SKILL.md`
- scripts
- references
- assets
- Python dependency declarations
- Node dependency declarations

All active skills in one conversation share one Python environment and one Node environment. Skills use the same native Bash execution capability as the agent.

### Layer 6: Runtime services

This layer owns execution infrastructure:

- Cancellation hierarchy
- Runtime event writer
- Message store interface
- Context checkpoint store interface
- Capability revision management
- Capability mutation guard
- Process supervision
- Background shell session management
- Crash reconciliation

### Layer 7: Interfaces and projections

The outermost layer exposes the runtime to humans and other systems:

- Local interactive CLI
- Runtime command interface
- HTTP control interface
- Runtime event streaming
- AG-UI projection

AG-UI is an output projection, not the internal durable event model.

## 3. Dependency rule

Dependencies point inward.

```text
Interfaces / projections
        |
Runtime services
        |
Model / Tool / Skill implementations
        |
Context engine
        |
Agent kernel
        |
Domain and protocol types
```

Forbidden dependencies include:

```text
Agent kernel -> OpenAI SDK
Agent kernel -> Anthropic SDK
Agent kernel -> rmcp
Agent kernel -> database client
Agent kernel -> HTTP framework
Agent kernel -> control-plane schema
```

## 4. Message model

The canonical conversation model contains four message classes:

```text
SystemMessageBlock
UserMessageBlock
AgentMessageBlock
ToolMessageBlock
```

Semantics:

- `SystemMessageBlock`: trusted instructions or runtime context.
- `UserMessageBlock`: inbound information supplied to the current agent. The source may be a human, another agent, the control plane, or an external system.
- `AgentMessageBlock`: model output produced by the current agent.
- `ToolMessageBlock`: result of a tool call produced by the current agent.

Identity and provenance are metadata. Message role does not encode real-world identity.

Provenance is implemented as typed runtime-owned metadata: `UserSource`
distinguishes human, agent, fleet, external-system, and runtime sources;
`SystemAuthority` distinguishes platform, agent, runtime, skill, and fleet
authority for system blocks. A future compaction summary is represented as a
`UserMessageBlock` with runtime provenance and `InboundKind::CompactionSummary`;
no fifth message role exists.

Agent-to-agent communication uses a durable mailbox model. A `send_message` tool result reports only whether delivery was durably accepted or rejected. The recipient later receives the content as a `UserMessageBlock`.

## 5. Turn model

A turn is:

```text
one model response
+ all tool calls emitted by that response
+ all corresponding tool results
```

Tool execution may be parallel or sequential. Runtime execution events may follow actual completion order, while canonical tool-result ordering follows the original tool-call order for deterministic context construction.

Inbound mailbox messages may arrive at any time but are injected only at safe turn boundaries.

## 6. Durability model

The runtime distinguishes execution events from conversation messages:

```text
RuntimeEvent = execution fact
MessageBlock = model-context fact
```

Runtime events are append-only. In production, events must be persisted before being published to external subscribers.

Partial model deltas are execution facts. A canonical `AgentMessageBlock` is committed only when a complete model response has been assembled. The model plane communicates through the normalized `ModelEvent` streaming protocol, which is an adapter-to-kernel fact stream and is never inserted into the canonical conversation history; the agent kernel assembles one `AgentMessageBlock` from it.

Exactly one terminal runtime event settles an attempt (see section 2.2). Committed-message events reference the message by identity only: canonical message content exists solely in the Message Ledger, and the Event Journal records the commit fact (see section 2.5).

Persist-before-publish is the frozen event-publication invariant:

```text
generate RuntimeEvent
→ durably append / commit sequence
→ publish externally
```

It applies to `RuntimeEvent` publication only and does not by itself provide
a transaction with the Message Ledger; cross-store atomicity or crash
reconciliation between the Message Ledger and Event Journal is owned by M8.

## 7. Recovery model

Runtime process memory is disposable.

Recovery uses durable state:

- committed message blocks
- runtime events
- capability revision
- context checkpoints
- workspace state

An unresolved tool call after a crash is never automatically replayed unless the tool explicitly declares an idempotent replay policy. The safe default is to commit an interrupted/unknown tool result and allow the model to decide what to do next.

## 8. Compatibility policy

Before 1.0, rustX intentionally does not preserve compatibility with previous runtimes or flawed abstractions. Breaking changes are preferred when they materially improve correctness, separation of concerns, or long-term maintainability.
